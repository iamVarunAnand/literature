# Literature Card Game in C++
The sole purpose of this project was to get a practical hands-on experience in Object-Oriented Programming concepts. All design decisions involved in this project were taken with the OOPS paradigm in mind. Some of the OOPS concepts utilised in the code include:

 1. **Data encapsulation:** All the data members of the classes are private, restricting access to these members from other classes
 2. **Polymorphism:** Multiple instances of polymorphism / function overloading can be found in the code, wherever appropriate
 3. **Data abstraction:** The game makes use of several abstract datatypes such as Suit, Value, Set and Messages throughout its execution.
